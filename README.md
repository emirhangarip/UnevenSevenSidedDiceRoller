OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project was to design and implement an uneven seven- sided dice roller using digital logic components. This included creating a 1-bit data generator,integrating a 2-bit full-adder circuit with one bit implemented at the transistor level in CMOS configuration, and utilizing two registers (RI: intermediate; RO: output) for data storage. The primary goal was to achieve a system capable of generating a random 3-bit number output refreshed at 100 Hz, suitable for interfacing with a microcontroller. These codes are used for showing clk frequencies, outputs and some inputs by using MATLAB and ARDUINO.
